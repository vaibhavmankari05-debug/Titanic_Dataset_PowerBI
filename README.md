Titanic Survival Analysis in Power BI This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset using Power BI to uncover factors that influenced passenger survival.

🎯 Project Goal:
 The primary goal of this analysis is to:Analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers.Identify key demographic and socio-economic factors (like passenger class, gender, and age) that correlate with survival.Visualize the insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📊 Key Findings (Illustrative Examples):
 The Power BI dashboard highlights several crucial insights:Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males, reflecting the "women and children first" protocol.Passenger Class (Pclass): First-class passengers generally had the highest survival rate, while Third-class passengers had the lowest, suggesting the impact of location and priority access to lifeboats.Age: Children (Age 0-9) often exhibited a better survival rate than adults, also aligning with the emergency protocol.

🛠️ Technology StackData Source:
 Titanic dataset (e.g., train.csv or similar version containing passenger details and survival status).Data Analysis & Visualization: Microsoft Power BI Desktop.Power Query was used for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering (e.g., creating age groups or family size).DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create measures (e.g., overall survival rate, survival count) and calculated columns.

🚀 How to View the DashboardPrerequisites:
 Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your system.Download: Clone this repository or download the TITANIC SURVIVAL ANALYSIS.pbix file (if available).Open: Double-click the .pbix file to open the dashboard in Power BI Desktop.Interact: Explore the different pages/tabs of the report and use the slicers and filters (e.g., Passenger Class, Embarked location) to interact with the visualizations and drill down into specific segments of the data.
